# OSINT tool (BETA)

[!] It's still in development process.

An OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) tool that I developed for the users of the THT (Turk Hack Team) forum platform, to use for educational purposes by examining the codes. It lists the results which found on social media platforms about the entered username or full name, with using two different browser APIs as Yandex and Google. It also provides detailed search with using DORKs.
It's helpful to do Open Source Intelligence (OSINT). Proxies, browser APIs (2 browsers for now) and DORKs used.
